    "text": "Typically, youth follow an expected growth curve, with gains in weight and height progressing in a predictable, but individualized manner reflecting previous development. In some cases, deviations from expected growth signal mental health concern. Historically, conceptualizations of restrictive-spectrum eating disorders (specifically anorexia nervosa) has included weight-related diagnostic markers informed by population-based norms; however, a large and growing body of research supports individualized markers of weight status (i.e. weight suppression – the difference between current and highest past weight status – which can be operationalized as deviation from expected growth amongst youth) as a key predictor of both risk and recovery for restrictive EDs. At present, use of individualized measurements to screen for and treat restrictive EDs is not widespread.\nThe current analyses aim to define a model which predicts expected growth (along with an expected window of BMI) for an individual across adolescence, based on data obtained from their height and weight throughout childhood. We will use this predicted model to examine whether a drop from expected BMI z-score during adolescence is likely to predict or be accompanied by eating disordered behaviors in the ALSPAC Cohort."

    "text": "3.1 Coding and Modeling BMIz from Growth Charts\nFirst, inputs (height and weight or raw BMI values with child age) are converted to BMIz score, which is plotted across childhood along with the mean BMIz and 95% confidence band for this mean. In the current study, we are using data from ages 2-13 years as our prediction set.\nAfter all available BMIz scores are input, prediction of future BMIz is forecast which accounts for recent measures of and variability in BMIz to forecast BMIz moving forward. Further, the overall number of observations and variance in previous BMIz to create a prediction window for future observations.\nThree starting models are: Mean, Random Walk, and Random Walk + Mean (RWM). In the mean model, the prediction window for BMIz score is responsive to variance of the BMIz scores in the prediction set, the predicted BMIz score is set at the mean of previous values, and the prediction interval stays constant over time. In the Random Walk model, the predicted value begins at the most recent BMIz data point (closest to age 13), and the prediction window begins very narrow, but widens over time, which accounts for increased confidence in observations that are more proximal to the last measurement. The Mean + Random Walk model combines both models, with a predicted BMIz between the mean of previous values and the most recent, and some widening of the prediction window over time. An alternative model might specify that the highest BMIz scores – regardless of age – define prediction (potentially defining a more conceptually pure value of developmental weight suppression).\nIn the following example, Participant 1, ‘Mara’, has routine observations with BMI-Z mean of ~ -0.5 in childhood. Participant 2, ‘Shannon’ has routine observations with a BMI-Z of ~ 0.5, fewer assessment points, and slightly higher variability in BMIz. The Mean(Figure 3.1), Random Walk(Figure 3.2), and RWM(Figure 3.3) models are presented below for visualization of expected BMIz over time after age 13 for these individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Example BMIz Prediction - Mean model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Example BMIz Prediction - RW Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Example BMIz Prediction - M1 Model\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1 Comparison with observed values\nThe below graphs back translate these BMI-Z forecasts to actual BMI numbers over time, using the example of the RWM model with a 95% confidence interval.

Those in the underweight group reported the lowest levels of fasting, which was significantly lower than those who did not have a weight reduction and were not underweight at age 14 (Table 4.3). The highest levels were amongst girls who experienced a BMIz reduction but were not underweight (Figure 4.5), though this was not significantly higher than those who did not have a weight reduction.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.3: Age 13 weight status vs. Age 14 Fasting - Female\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimate\nStd.

That is, we can identify deviation from eBMIz or eBMI based on the point predictions of different models (Mean, Random Walk (most recent BMIz), M1, Highest Ever BMIz) and examine whether the magnitude of these deviations at age 13, along with absolute weight status (BMIz), associates with ED behaviors at age 14.\nConsider running continuous models – which continuous models to run?"
